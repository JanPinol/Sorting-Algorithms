# Sorting Algorithms
This Java project simulates a system for managing ships with functionalities for sorting and organizing data. It supports three main sorting algorithms: quicksort to sort ships by age (from newest to oldest), mergesort to alphabetically list ships by name, and bucket sort to evaluate and rank ships based on competitive quality. The competitive quality takes into account various attributes such as weight, length, capacity, and maximum speed. The program reads ship data from a file, processes it, and can display sorted lists according to the specified criteria. Additionally, it provides methods for managing ship data, including adding new ships and organizing them for easy retrieval and analysis.
